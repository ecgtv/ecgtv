ecg tv kodi addon


Ok so i previosly was using a free webserver but it was crap lol so am going to this a try as i really want to keep everything free with no overheads then i wont need to do the STUPID thing of making people pay for kodi addons. Kodi is not in anyway affiliated with this addon or any of my other work. any content within the addon is freely available on the internet. Now that i have finally set up a github account and figured out how to roughly use it i am going to start developing the addon for Kodi V17 (pre release currently)

More info to come on installation instructions etc when i have got everything set up and working. :)

Thanks
